Yesterday, the kick-off meeting for Travelogues took place at the INZ in Vienna.

For the meeting, a group of thirteen people came together, either working directly on the project or supporting those who do. They represented the [Austrian Academy of Science - INZ](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/inz/), [Austrian National Library](https://www.onb.ac.at/en/), [LUH/L3S](https://www.l3s.de/en/home), [Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at/en/) and the [Alpen Adria Universit√§t](https://www.aau.at/en/).

During the very productive 2.5 hours, followed by a group lunch, a number of mostly organisational aspects were discussed, putting down the basis for three years of exciting research and innovative collaboration between historians and computer scientists.

Updates will be published here throughout the course of the project on a regular-ish base - you may also want to take a look at our [Resources](/resources) section, where upcoming publications and published code will be linked (for the latter, see [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/Travelogues) as well).
