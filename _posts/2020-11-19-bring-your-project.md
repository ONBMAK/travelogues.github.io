ONB Labs' [Bring your project](https://www.onb.ac.at/en/research/research-activities-at-the-austrian-national-library/bring-your-project) initiative (Philip RÃ¶ggla), funded by CLARIAH-AT, supported our work on bibliographic metadata in two ways:

1. by setting up a customized extraction workflow from the integrated library system ALMA into a spreadsheet

2. by running an alignment of our corpus of 17th century travelogues with the VD17 (_Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachraum erschienenen Drucke des 17. Jahrhunderts_) and a search query on the library catalogue in order to find further additions to our corpus.

As a result we now have our data sets in a handy format reusable for our corpus analysis, which is also easier for non-librarians to read and work with than the "sticky" MARC-XML. By comparing our corpus to the VD17 we get a better understanding of the representativeness of our corpus.

You can find a concise documentation in a blog-post on ONB Labs: [Enriching Metadata for Travelogues](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/topic/vd17-analysis/). Results of the VD17-alignment will be published in an upcoming post.
