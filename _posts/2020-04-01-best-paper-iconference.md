We are very proud to announce that our paper "Identifying Travelogues in Large Text Corpora Using Machine Learning"
won the Lee Dirks Ward for Best Full Paper at the iConference 2020 in Bor√•s (Sweden). We would also like to thank 
the organizers of the conference for doing such a great job in making the whole event an online-only format and 
giving us the opportunity of worldwide exchange from our homes.
